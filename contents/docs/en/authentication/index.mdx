### Supabase Authentication

Supabase offers a range of authentication services to save developers the hassle of building custom authentication systems from scratch.
Supabase authentication works with many popular authentication methods, including social authentication and phone authentication using third-party providers. 
For a list of supported third-party providers, see the following [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth).
