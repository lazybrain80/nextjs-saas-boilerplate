## What is a Boilerplate?

A boilerplate is a collection of necessary files and configurations needed for development. Boilerplates make creating applications easier by including basic setups such as routing, state management, styling, layout, etc. Technologies like Next.js, React.js, Vue.js, Angular, Express.js, etc., provide commands to create a boilerplate. A boilerplate can be generated using a command or by importing any boilerplate repository from GitHub.

## What are the advantages of using Boilerplate code?

- **Well-organized**: Includes pages (components), public folders, styles, layout, and more.
- **Faster Project Creation**: Speeds up the initial setup process.
- **Additional Tooling Support**: Easily add TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.

## How can Boilerplates improve the code Structure?

- **Predefined Structure**: Provides a well-organized code template.
- **Modular Code**: Divides code into small, manageable blocks.
- **Starting Point**: Includes essential elements already in place.
